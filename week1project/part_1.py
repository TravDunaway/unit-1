# Step 7 - print and type functions
# Follow the instructions, and below this line, code all of the suggested print statements and the type statements.
# Code below



# Step 1 Let's assign variables to represent a book you enjoy.

# Step 2 - Strings
# Let's start with Python strings. Replace the "None" with the name of a book, and below the name of the author of your book.

# # # book_name = "Dune"
# author = "Frank Herbert"
# 
# # Step 3 - Concatenation and f-strings
# Use concatenation and f-strings to make a sentence about your author and book name.

# # sentence1 = book_name +`
# # Step 4 - Integers
# Now let's practice Integers. Replace the "None" below with the publication date of your book.

# publication_year = 1965
# 
# # Step 5 - Floats
# Now estimate what the retail value of your book would be at a store and replace the "None" below with a float value of the price. (Doesn't have to be accurate.)

# book_price = 17.99
# 
# # Step 6 - Booleans
# Now we will practice with booleans. Replace the "is_awesome" variable with a boolean. True if your book is awesome, False if your book is not awesome.

# is_awesome = True
